and honors fluctuated between them .', 'Miss Barry , who was sitting behind them , leaned forward and poked Marilla in the back with her parasol .', 'Well now -- if it isnâ\\x80\\x99t too much trouble

the middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was sharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe .', 'The whitewashed walls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache over their own bareness .', 'When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me .', 'I do nâ \\x80\\x99t know .', 'Suppose you jump up and tell

only going to be here a little while , can it ?', 'It makes me so glad to be alive .', 'You must just imagine it .', 'Her knees trembled , her heart fluttered , a horrible faintness came over her ; not a word could she utter , and the next moment she would have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which , she felt , must ever after be her portion if she did so .', 'She was so pale that Diana and Jane , down in the audience , clasped each otherâ\\x80\\x99s hands in nervous sympathy .', 'I do nâ \\x80\\x99t know what on earth you mean .', 'The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting

some of its rich hours in the orchard ; she went to the Dryadâ\\x80 \\x99s Bubble and Willowmere and Violet Vale ; she called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with Mrs. Allan ; and finally in
