              "  '|MRS. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool and cascade; but by the time it reached Lyndeâ\\x80\\x99s Hollow it was a quiet, well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs. Rachel Lyndeâ\\x80\\x99s door without due regard for decency and decorum; it probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window, keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children up, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.',\n",
              "  'There are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend closely to their neighborâ\\x80\\x99s business by dint of neglecting their own; but Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a notable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she â\\x80\\x9cranâ\\x80\\x9d the Sewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop of the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all this Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window, knitting â\\x80\\x9ccotton warpâ\\x80\\x9d quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them, as Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two sides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachelâ\\x80\\x99s all-seeing eye.',\n",
              "  'She was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees. Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called â\\x80\\x9cRachel Lyndeâ\\x80\\x99s husbandâ\\x80\\x9d--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on the big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening before in William J. Blairâ\\x80\\x99s store over at Carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for Matthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life.',\n",
              "  'And yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon of a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill; moreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable distance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going there?',\n",
              "  'Had it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this and that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions. But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy, was something that didnâ\\x80\\x99t happen often. Mrs. Rachel, ponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoonâ\\x80\\x99s enjoyment was spoiled.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla where heâ\\x80\\x99s gone and why,â\\x80\\x9d the worthy woman finally concluded. â\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t generally go to town this time of year and he _never_ visits; if heâ\\x80\\x99d run out of turnip seed he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t dress up and take the buggy to go for more; he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t driving fast enough to be going for a doctor. Yet something must have happened since last night to start him off. Iâ\\x80\\x99m clean puzzled, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what, and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t know a minuteâ\\x80\\x99s peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the big, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from Lyndeâ\\x80\\x99s Hollow. To be sure, the long lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbertâ\\x80\\x99s father, as shy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so sociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place _living_ at all.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s just _staying_, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what,â\\x80\\x9d she said as she stepped along the deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by themselves. Trees arenâ\\x80\\x99t much company, though dear knows if they were thereâ\\x80\\x99d be enough of them. Iâ\\x80\\x99d ruther look at people. To be sure, they seem contented enough; but then, I suppose, theyâ\\x80\\x99re used to it. A body can get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'With this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green Gables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies. Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have seen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla Cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house. One could have eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial peck of dirt.',\n",
              "  'Mrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful apartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. Its windows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on the back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one, whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left orchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook, was greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind her was laid for supper.',\n",
              "  'Mrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental note of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid, so that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves and one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any particular company. Yet what of Matthewâ\\x80\\x99s white collar and the sorrel mare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cGood evening, Rachel,â\\x80\\x9d Marilla said briskly. â\\x80\\x9cThis is a real fine evening, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? Wonâ\\x80\\x99t you sit down? How are all your folks?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel, in spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity.',\n",
              "  'Marilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she was; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had been ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re all pretty well,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Rachel. â\\x80\\x9cI was kind of afraid _you_ werenâ\\x80\\x99t, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe he was going to the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s lips twitched understandingly. She had expected Mrs. Rachel up; she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighborâ\\x80\\x99s curiosity.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, no, Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cMatthew went to Bright River. Weâ\\x80\\x99re getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and heâ\\x80\\x99s coming on the train tonight.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'If Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a kangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished. She was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable that Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to suppose it.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cAre you in earnest, Marilla?â\\x80\\x9d she demanded when voice returned to her.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cYes, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums in Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated Avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.',\n",
              "  'Mrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. She thought in exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people adopting a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly turning upside down! She would be surprised at nothing after this! Nothing!',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth put such a notion into your head?â\\x80\\x9d she demanded disapprovingly.',\n",
              "  'This had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be disapproved.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell, weâ\\x80\\x99ve been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'returned Marilla. â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs. Spencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have talked it over off and on ever since. We thought weâ\\x80\\x99d get a boy. Matthew is getting up in years, you know--heâ\\x80\\x99s sixty--and he isnâ\\x80\\x99t so spry as he once was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate hard itâ\\x80\\x99s got to be to get hired help. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s never anybody to be had but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something heâ\\x80\\x99s up and off to the lobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a Home boy. But I said â\\x80\\x98noâ\\x80\\x99 flat to that. â\\x80\\x98They may be all right--Iâ\\x80\\x99m not saying theyâ\\x80\\x99re not--but no London street Arabs for me,â\\x80\\x99 I said. â\\x80\\x98Give me a native born at least. Thereâ\\x80\\x99ll be a risk, no matter who we get. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian.â\\x80\\x99 So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she was going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencerâ\\x80\\x99s folks at Carmody to bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that would be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him a good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to meet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to White Sands station herself.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Mrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind; she proceeded to speak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell, Marilla, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just tell you plain that I think youâ\\x80\\x99re doing a mighty foolish thing--a risky thing, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what. You donâ\\x80\\x99t know what youâ\\x80\\x99re getting. Youâ\\x80\\x99re bringing a strange child into your house and home and you donâ\\x80\\x99t know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had nor how heâ\\x80\\x99s likely to turn out. Why, it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night--set it _on purpose_, Marilla--and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds. And I know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs--they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t break him of it. If you had asked my advice in the matter--which you didnâ\\x80\\x99t do, Marilla--Iâ\\x80\\x99d have said for mercyâ\\x80\\x99s sake not to think of such a thing, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'This Jobâ\\x80\\x99s comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla. She knitted steadily on.',\n",

I could see that, so I gave in. Itâ\\x80\\x99s so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does I always feel itâ\\x80\\x99s my duty to give in. And as for the risk, thereâ\\x80\\x99s risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s risks in peopleâ\\x80\\x99s having children of their own if it comes to that--they donâ\\x80\\x99t always turn out well. And then Nova Scotia is right close to the Island.

So she took herself away, somewhat to Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s relief, for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of Mrs. Rachelâ\\x80\\x99s pessimism.',\n",

Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry for that poor young one and no mistake. Matthew and Marilla donâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about children and theyâ\\x80\\x99ll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather, if so beâ\\x80\\x99s he ever had a grandfather, which is doubtful. It seems uncanny to think of a child at Green Gables somehow; thereâ\\x80\\x99s never been one there, for Matthew and Marilla were grown up when the new house was built--if they ever _were_ children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them.

It was a pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads, with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom. The air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple; while',\n",

He may have been quite right in thinking so, for he was an odd-looking personage, with an ungainly figure and long iron-gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders, and a full, soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty. In fact, he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grayness.',\n",

The long platform was almost deserted; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end. Matthew, barely noting that it _was_ a girl, sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her. Had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression. She was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and, since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all her might and main.',\n",

Sheâ\\x80\\x99s sitting out there on the shingles. I asked her to go into the ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside. â\\x80\\x98There was more scope for imagination,â\\x80\\x99 she said.

Matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her.',\n",

Matthew was not looking at her and would not have seen what she was really like if he had been, but an ordinary observer would have seen this: A child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very tight, very ugly dress of yellowish-gray wincey. She wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.',\n",

I was beginning to be afraid you werenâ\\x80\\x99t coming for me and I was imagining all the things that might have happened to prevent you. I had made up my mind that if you didnâ\\x80\\x99t come for me to-night Iâ\\x80\\x99d go down the track to that big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all night. I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think? You could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldnâ\\x80\\x99t you? And I was quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didnâ\\x80\\x99t to-night.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

He could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake; he would take her home and let Marilla do that. She couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be left at Bright River anyhow, no matter what mistake had been made, so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at Green Gables.',\n",

Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got all my worldly goods in it, but it isnâ\\x80\\x99t heavy. And if it isnâ\\x80\\x99t carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so Iâ\\x80\\x99d better keep it because I know the exact knack of it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an extremely old carpet-bag. Oh, Iâ\\x80\\x99m very glad youâ\\x80\\x99ve come, even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got to drive a long piece, havenâ\\x80\\x99t we? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles. Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad because I love driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to live with you and belong to you. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never belonged to anybody--not really. But the asylum was the worst. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve only been in it four months, but that was enough. I donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you canâ\\x80\\x99t possibly understand what it is like. Itâ\\x80\\x99s worse than anything you could imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean to be wicked. Itâ\\x80\\x99s so easy to be wicked without knowing it, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? They were good, you know--the asylum people. But there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum--only just in the other orphans. It was pretty interesting to imagine things about them--to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a belted earl, who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess. I used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because I didnâ\\x80\\x99t have time in the day. I guess thatâ\\x80\\x99s why Iâ\\x80\\x99m so thin--I _am_ dreadful thin, ainâ\\x80\\x99t I? There isnâ\\x80\\x99t a pick on my bones.

I donâ\\x80\\x99t ever expect to be a bride myself. Iâ\\x80\\x99m so homely nobody will ever want to marry me--unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign missionary mightnâ\\x80\\x99t be very particular. But I do hope that some day I shall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I just love pretty clothes. And Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember--but of course itâ\\x80\\x99s all the more to look forward to, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? And then I can imagine that Iâ\\x80\\x99m dressed gorgeously. This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know. A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t sell it, but Iâ\\x80\\x99d rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you _are_ imagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and boots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my might. I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither was Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadnâ\\x80\\x99t time to get sick, watching to see that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t fall overboard. She said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from being seasick itâ\\x80\\x99s a mercy I did prowl, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? And I wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know whether Iâ\\x80\\x99d ever have another opportunity. Oh, there are a lot more cherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I just love it already, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m so glad Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to live here. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always heard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world, and I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I would. Itâ\\x80\\x99s delightful when your imaginations come true, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? But those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didnâ\\x80\\x99t know and for pityâ\\x80\\x99s sake not to ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand already. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about things if you donâ\\x80\\x99t ask questions? And what _does_ make the roads red?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. But he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl. But this freckled witch was very different, and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes he thought that he â\\x80\\x9ckind of liked her chatter.â\\x80\\x9d So he said as shyly as usual:',\n",

Itâ\\x80\\x99s the first thing I ever saw that couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be improved upon by imagination.

There is no meaning in a name like that. They should call it--let me see--the White Way of Delight. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that a nice imaginative name? When I donâ\\x80\\x99t like the name of a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of them so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins, but I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that place the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight. Have we really only another mile to go before we get home? Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and Iâ\\x80\\x99m always sorry when pleasant things end. Something still pleasanter may come after, but you can never be sure. And itâ\\x80\\x99s so often the case that it isnâ\\x80\\x99t pleasanter. That has been my experience anyhow. But Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad to think of getting home. You see, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never had a real home since I can remember.

A bridge spanned it midway and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of sand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a glory of many shifting hues--the most spiritual shadings of crocus and rose and ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name has ever been found. Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing groves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering shadows. Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a white-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection. From the marsh at the head of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.

In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner table adorned with a fat, red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the point of the most adventurous pin. Above it hung a little six-by-eight mirror. Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white muslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand. The whole apartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which sent a shiver to the very marrow of Anneâ\\x80\\x99s bones. With a sob she hastily discarded her garments, put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed where she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes over her head.

Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was to stay here for ever and ever. It was a great comfort while it lasted.

              "  'â\\x80\\x9cI was eleven last March,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne, resigning herself to bald facts with a little sigh. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia. My fatherâ\\x80\\x99s name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the Bolingbroke High School. My motherâ\\x80\\x99s name was Bertha Shirley. Arenâ\\x80\\x99t Walter and Bertha lovely names?

              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x9d Anne looked thoughtful. â\\x80\\x9cI read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never been able to believe it. I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I suppose my father could have been a good man even if he had been called Jedediah; but Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure it would have been a cross. Well, my mother was a teacher in the High school, too, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A husband was enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that they were a pair of babies and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a weeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never seen that house, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve imagined it thousands of times. I think it must have had honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in all the windows. Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born in that house. Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I was so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I was perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you? Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad she was satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her--because she didnâ\\x80\\x99t live very long after that, you see. She died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish sheâ\\x80\\x99d lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it would be so sweet to say â\\x80\\x98mother,â\\x80\\x99 donâ\\x80\\x99t you? And father died four days afterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at their witsâ\\x80\\x99 end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see, nobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother had both come from places far away and it was well known they hadnâ\\x80\\x99t any relatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said sheâ\\x80\\x99d take me, though she was poor and had a drunken husband. She brought me up by hand. Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people? Because whenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cMr. and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville, and I lived with them until I was eight years old. I helped look after the Thomas children--there were four of them younger than me--and I can tell you they took a lot of looking after. Then Mr. Thomas was killed falling under a train and his mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the children, but she didnâ\\x80\\x99t want me. Mrs. Thomas was at _her_ witsâ\\x80\\x99 end, so she said, what to do with me. Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came down and said sheâ\\x80\\x99d take me, seeing I was handy with children, and I went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the stumps. It was a very lonesome place. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I could never have lived there if I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t had an imagination. Mr. Hammond worked a little sawmill up there, and Mrs. Hammond had eight children. She had twins three times. I like babies in moderation, but twins three times in succession is _too much_. I told Mrs. Hammond so firmly, when the last pair came. I used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cI lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond died and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping. She divided her children among her relatives and went to the States. I had to go to the asylum at Hopeton, because nobody would take me. They didnâ\\x80\\x99t want me at the asylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. But they had to take me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

When I went up river we were so far from a school that I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t walk it in winter and there was a vacation in summer, so I could only go in the spring and fall. But of course I went while I was at the asylum. I can read pretty well and I know ever so many pieces of poetry off by heart--â\\x80\\x98The Battle of Hohenlindenâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98Edinburgh after Flodden,â\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98Bingen of the Rhine,â\\x80\\x99 and most of the â\\x80\\x98Lady of the Lakeâ\\x80\\x99 and most of â\\x80\\x98The Seasonsâ\\x80\\x99 by James Thompson. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back? There is a piece in the Fifth Reader--â\\x80\\x98The Downfall of Polandâ\\x80\\x99--that is just full of thrills. Of course, I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t in the Fifth Reader--I was only in the Fourth--but the big girls used to lend me theirs to read.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

And when people mean to be good to you, you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind very much when theyâ\\x80\\x99re not quite--always. They had a good deal to worry them, you know. Itâ\\x80\\x99s  a very trying to have a drunken husband, you see; and it must be very trying to have twins three times in succession, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think?

No wonder she had been so delighted at the prospect of a real home. It was a pity she had to be sent back.

Down at the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy coves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels; beyond lay the sea, shimmering and blue, and over it soared the gulls, their pinions flashing silvery in the sunlight.',\n",

Next to being beautiful oneself--and thatâ\\x80\\x99s impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom friend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting room with glass doors. There werenâ\\x80\\x99t any books in it; Mrs. Thomas kept her best china and her preserves there--when she had any preserves to keep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one night when he was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used to pretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in it. I called her Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to talk to her by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her everything. Katie was the comfort and consolation of my life. We used to pretend that the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I could open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice lived, instead of into Mrs. Thomasâ\\x80\\x99 shelves of preserves and china. And then Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a wonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have lived there happy for ever after. When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond it just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice. She felt it dreadfully, too, I know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye through the bookcase door. There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammondâ\\x80\\x99s. But just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green little valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every word you said, even if you didnâ\\x80\\x99t talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it was a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved her almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice--not quite, but almost, you know. The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta, and oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. I had become so attached to her that I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t the heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination there.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

A severe and unseasonable attack of grippe had confined that good lady to her house ever since the occasion of her last visit to Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel was not often sick and had a well-defined contempt for people who were; but grippe, she asserted, was like no other illness on earth and could only be interpreted as one of the special visitations of Providence. As soon as her doctor allowed her to put her foot out-of-doors she hurried up to Green Gables, bursting with curiosity to see Matthew and Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s orphan, concerning whom all sorts of stories and suppositions had gone abroad in Avonlea.',\n",

              "  'She had made friends with the spring down in the hollow--that wonderful deep, clear icy-cold spring; it was set about with smooth red sandstones and rimmed in by great palm-like clumps of water fern; and beyond it was a log bridge over the brook.',\n",

Avonlea little girls had already heard queer stories about Anne.

It isnâ\\x80\\x99t a really truly religious piece of poetry, but itâ\\x80\\x99s so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next Sunday. I read it over in church afterwards and itâ\\x80\\x99s splendid.

I sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third chapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text. If I was a minister Iâ\\x80\\x99d pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long, too. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t think he was a bit interesting.

Iâ\\x80\\x99m an inch taller than Diana, but she is ever so much fatter; she says sheâ\\x80\\x99d like to be thin because itâ\\x80\\x99s so much more graceful, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid she only said it to soothe my feelings.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s just one little seam after another and you never seem to be getting anywhere. But of course Iâ\\x80\\x99d rather be Anne of Green Gables sewing patchwork than Anne of any other place with nothing to do but play. I wish time went as quick sewing patches as it does when Iâ\\x80\\x99m playing with Diana, though. Oh, we do have such elegant times, Marilla. I have to furnish most of the imagination, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m well able to do that. Diana is simply perfect in every other way. You know that little piece of land across the brook that runs up between our farm and Mr. Barryâ\\x80\\x99s. It belongs to Mr. William Bell, and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch trees--the most romantic spot, Marilla. Diana and I have our playhouse there. We call it Idlewild. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that a poetical name? I assure you it took me some time to think it out. I stayed awake nearly a whole night before I invented it. Then, just as I was dropping off to sleep, it came like an inspiration. Diana was _enraptured_ when she heard it. We have got our house fixed up elegantly. You must come and see it, Marilla--wonâ\\x80\\x99t you? We have great big stones, all covered with moss, for seats, and boards from tree to tree for shelves. And we have all our dishes on them. Of course, theyâ\\x80\\x99re all broken but itâ\\x80\\x99s the easiest thing in the world to imagine that they are whole. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful. We keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there, too. The fairy glass is as lovely as a dream. Diana found it out in the woods behind their chicken house. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all full of rainbows--just little young rainbows that havenâ\\x80\\x99t grown big yet--and Dianaâ\\x80\\x99s mother told her it was broken off a hanging lamp they once had. But itâ\\x80\\x99s nice to imagine the fairies lost it one night when they had a ball, so we call it the fairy glass. Matthew is going to make us a table. Oh, we have named that little round pool over in Mr. Barryâ\\x80\\x99s field Willowmere. I got that name out of the book Diana lent me. That was a thrilling book, Marilla. The heroine had five lovers. Iâ\\x80\\x99d be satisfied with one, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you? She was very handsome and she went through great tribulations. She could faint as easy as anything. Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to be able to faint, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you, Marilla? Itâ\\x80\\x99s so romantic. But Iâ\\x80\\x99m really very healthy for all Iâ\\x80\\x99m so thin. I believe Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting fatter, though. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you think I am? I look at my elbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming. Diana is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves. She is going to wear it to the picnic. Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday. I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me from getting to the picnic. I suppose Iâ\\x80\\x99d live through it, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m certain it would be a lifelong sorrow. It wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t matter if I got to a hundred picnics in after years; they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t make up for missing this one. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to have boats on the Lake of Shining Waters--and ice cream, as I told you. I have never tasted ice cream.

It would be so much easier to imagine I was the Lady Cordelia if I had a real amethyst brooch on. Diana and I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts? So I took the brooch. I thought I could put it back before you came home. I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time. When I was going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters I took the brooch off to have another look at it. Oh, how it did shine in the sunlight!

I guess he can teach _you_ something, and itâ\\x80\\x99s your business to learn. And I want you to understand right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him.

Our seat is right by the window and we can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters. There are a lot of nice girls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime. Itâ\\x80\\x99s so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with. But of course I like Diana best and always will. I _adore_ Diana. Iâ\\x80\\x99m dreadfully far behind the others. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re all in the fifth book and Iâ\\x80\\x99m only in the fourth. I feel that itâ\\x80\\x99s kind of a disgrace. But thereâ\\x80\\x99s not one of them has such an imagination as I have and I soon found that out. We had reading and geography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Phillips said my spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could see it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have been politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with â\\x80\\x98May I see you home?â\\x80\\x99 on it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m to give it back to her tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear her bead ring all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh, Marilla, Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she heard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose. Marilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you canâ\\x80\\x99t imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. Marilla, have I really a pretty nose? I know youâ\\x80\\x99ll tell me the truth.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Presently Ruby Gillis started up to take a sum to the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek, believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots.

She is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you, Diana, it is uphill work. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just have to go by rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in. I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me, Diana. I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you, but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life; and then I took the smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears; and you never, never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you. Oh, it was such a pathetic tale, Diana. The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake. But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure. Flour is so essential to cakes, you know. Marilla was very cross and I donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a great trial to her. She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week. We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over. Marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it. I meant to cover it just as much as could be, Diana, but when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun--of course Iâ\\x80\\x99m a Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic--taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce. I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry. Diana, fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters. Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if Iâ\\x80\\x99d give the sauce to the pigs; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow, whichever they wanted to be, so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples. Well, Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning. You know they are very stylish people, especially Mrs. Chester Ross. When Marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table. I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be, for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t pretty. Everything went right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce _warmed up_, in the other. Diana, that was a terrible moment. I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out â\\x80\\x98Marilla, you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t use that pudding sauce. There was a mouse drowned in it. I forgot to tell you before.â\\x80\\x99 Oh, Diana, I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred. Mrs. Chester Ross just _looked_ at me and I thought I would sink through the floor with mortification. She is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us. Marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word--then. She just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves. She even offered me some, but I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t swallow a mouthful. It was like heaping coals of fire on my head. After Mrs. Chester Ross went away, Marilla gave me a dreadful scolding.

At first glance it might not seem that the decision of a certain Canadian Premier to include Prince Edward Island in a political tour could have much or anything to do with the fortunes of little Anne Shirley at Green Gables. But it had.',\n",
              "  'It was a January the Premier came, to address his loyal supporters and such of his nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass meeting held in Charlottetown. Most of the Avonlea people were on Premierâ\\x80\\x99s side of politics; hence on the night of the meeting nearly all the men and a goodly proportion of the women had gone to town thirty miles away. Mrs. Rachel Lynde had gone too. Mrs. Rachel Lynde was a red-hot politician and couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have believed that the political rally could be carried through without her, although she was on the opposite side of politics. So she went to town and took her husband--Thomas would be useful in looking after the horse--and Marilla Cuthbert with her. Marilla had a sneaking interest in politics herself, and as she thought it might be her only chance to see a real live Premier, she promptly took it, leaving Anne and Matthew to keep house until her return the following day.',\n",
              "  'Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely at the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green Gables all to themselves. A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned Waterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the windowpanes. Matthew nodded over a _Farmersâ\\x80\\x99 Advocate_ on the sofa and Anne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination, despite sundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that Jane Andrews had lent her that day. Jane had assured her that it was warranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and Anneâ\\x80\\x99s fingers tingled to reach out for it. But that would mean Gilbert Blytheâ\\x80\\x99s triumph on the morrow. Anne turned her back on the clock shelf and tried to imagine it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cMatthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell now, no, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Matthew, coming out of his doze with a start.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cI wish you had,â\\x80\\x9d sighed Anne, â\\x80\\x9cbecause then youâ\\x80\\x99d be able to sympathize with me. You canâ\\x80\\x99t sympathize properly if youâ\\x80\\x99ve never studied it. It is casting a cloud over my whole life. Iâ\\x80\\x99m such a dunce at it, Matthew.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell now, I dunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Matthew soothingly. â\\x80\\x9cI guess youâ\\x80\\x99re all right at anything. Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blairâ\\x80\\x99s store at Carmody that you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid progress. â\\x80\\x98Rapid progressâ\\x80\\x99 was his very words. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s them as runs down Teddy Phillips and says he ainâ\\x80\\x99t much of a teacher, but I guess heâ\\x80\\x99s all right.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Matthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was â\\x80\\x9call right.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure Iâ\\x80\\x99d get on better with geometry if only he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t change the letters,â\\x80\\x9d complained Anne. â\\x80\\x9cI learn the proposition off by heart and then he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what are in the book and I get all mixed up. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think a teacher should take such a mean advantage, do you? Weâ\\x80\\x99re studying agriculture now and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve found out at last what makes the roads red. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a great comfort. I wonder how Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves. Mrs. Lynde says Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa and that itâ\\x80\\x99s an awful warning to the electors. She says if women were allowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change. What way do you vote, Matthew?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cConservative,â\\x80\\x9d said Matthew promptly. To vote Conservative was part of Matthewâ\\x80\\x99s religion.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cThen Iâ\\x80\\x99m Conservative too,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne decidedly. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m glad because Gil--because some of the boys in school are Grits. I guess Mr. Phillips is a Grit too because Prissy Andrewsâ\\x80\\x99s father is one, and Ruby Gillis says that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girlâ\\x80\\x99s mother in religion and her father in politics. Is that true, Matthew?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell now, I dunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Matthew.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cDid you ever go courting, Matthew?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell now, no, I dunnoâ\\x80\\x99s I ever did,â\\x80\\x9d said Matthew, who had certainly never thought of such a thing in his whole existence.',\n",
              "  'Anne reflected with her chin in her hands.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cIt must be rather interesting, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think, Matthew? Ruby Gillis says when she grows up sheâ\\x80\\x99s going to have ever so many beaus on the string and have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too exciting. Iâ\\x80\\x99d rather have just one in his right mind. But Ruby Gillis knows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big sisters, and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot cakes. Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening. He says it is to help her with her lessons but Miranda Sloane is studying for Queenâ\\x80\\x99s too, and I should think she needed help a lot more than Prissy because sheâ\\x80\\x99s ever so much stupider, but he never goes to help her in the evenings at all. There are a great many things in this world that I canâ\\x80\\x99t understand very well, Matthew.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,â\\x80\\x9d acknowledged Matthew.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell, I suppose I must finish up my lessons. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t allow myself to open that new book Jane lent me until Iâ\\x80\\x99m through. But itâ\\x80\\x99s a terrible temptation, Matthew. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there just as plain. Jane said she cried herself sick over it. I love a book that makes me cry. But I think Iâ\\x80\\x99ll carry that book into the sitting room and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key. And you must _not_ give it to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if I implore you on my bended knees. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all very well to say resist temptation, but itâ\\x80\\x99s ever so much easier to resist it if you canâ\\x80\\x99t get the key. And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets, Matthew? Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you like some russets?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell now, I dunno but what I would,â\\x80\\x9d said Matthew, who never ate russets but knew Anneâ\\x80\\x99s weakness for them.',\n",
              "  'Just as Anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of russets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside and the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed Diana Barry, white faced and breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around her head. Anne promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise, and plate, candle, and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder and were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease, the next day, by Marilla, who gathered them up and thanked mercy the house hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been set on fire.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWhatever is the matter, Diana?â\\x80\\x9d cried Anne. â\\x80\\x9cHas your mother relented at last?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, Anne, do come quick,â\\x80\\x9d implored Diana nervously. â\\x80\\x9cMinnie May is awful sick--sheâ\\x80\\x99s got croup. Young Mary Joe says--and Father and Mother are away to town and thereâ\\x80\\x99s nobody to go for the doctor. Minnie May is awful bad and Young Mary Joe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do--and oh, Anne, Iâ\\x80\\x99m so scared!â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Young Mary Joe never saw anybody with croup and Mrs. Lynde is away. Oh, Anne!â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t cry, Di,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne cheerily. â\\x80\\x9cI know exactly what to do for croup. You forget that Mrs. Hammond had twins three times. When you look after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience. They all had croup regularly. Just wait till I get the ipecac bottle--you maynâ\\x80\\x99t have any at your house. Come on now.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'The two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through Loverâ\\x80\\x99s Lane and across the crusted field beyond, for the snow was too deep to go by the shorter wood way. Anne, although sincerely sorry for Minnie May, was far from being insensible to the romance of the situation and to the sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a kindred spirit.',\n",
              "  'The night was clear and frosty, all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy slope; big stars were shining over the silent fields; here and there the dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the wind whistling through them. Anne thought it was truly delightful to go skimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend who had been so long estranged.',\n",

Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl from the creek, whom Mrs. Barry had engaged to stay with the children during her absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of thinking what to do, or doing it if she thought of it.',\n",

I declare, Diana, there isnâ\\x80\\x99t more than a cupful in the kettle! There, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve filled it up, and, Mary Joe, you may put some wood in the stove. I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to hurt your feelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if youâ\\x80\\x99d any imagination. Now, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll undress Minnie May and put her to bed and you try to find some soft flannel cloths, Diana. Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to give her a dose of ipecac first of all.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Minnie May did not take kindly to the ipecac but Anne had not brought up three pairs of twins for nothing. Down that ipecac went, not only once, but many times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls worked patiently over the suffering Minnie May, and Young Mary Joe, honestly anxious to do all she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated more water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies.',\n",
              "  'It was three oâ\\x80\\x99clock when Matthew came with a doctor, for he had been obliged to go all the way to Spencervale for one. But the pressing need for assistance was past. Minnie May was much better and was sleeping soundly.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cI was awfully near giving up in despair,â\\x80\\x9d explained Anne. â\\x80\\x9cShe got worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the Hammond twins were, even the last pair. I actually thought she was going to choke to death. I gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose went down I said to myself--not to Diana or Young Mary Joe, because I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to worry them any more than they were worried, but I had to say it to myself just to relieve my feelings--â\\x80\\x98This is the last lingering hope and I fear, tis a vain one.â\\x80\\x99 But in about three minutes she coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away. You must just imagine my relief, doctor, because I canâ\\x80\\x99t express it in words. You know there are some things that cannot be expressed in words.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cYes, I know,â\\x80\\x9d nodded the doctor. He looked at Anne as if he were thinking some things about her that couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be expressed in words. Later on, however, he expressed them to Mr. and Mrs. Barry.',\n",

Iâ\\x80\\x99m real sorry I was ever cross with Mrs. Hammond for having twins. But, oh, Matthew, Iâ\\x80\\x99m so sleepy. I canâ\\x80\\x99t go to school. I just know I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t keep my eyes open and Iâ\\x80\\x99d be so stupid. But I hate to stay home, for Gil--some of the others will get head of the class, and itâ\\x80\\x99s so hard to get up again--although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you have when you do get up, havenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

I was proud of being a Conservative. Rachel Lynde, of course, being a Liberal, had no use for him. Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get yourself some blue plum preserve out of the pantry. I guess youâ\\x80\\x99re hungry. Matthew has been telling me about last night. I must say it was fortunate you knew what to do. I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have had any idea myself, for I never saw a case of croup. There now, never mind talking till youâ\\x80\\x99ve had your dinner.

Diana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and let it burn; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away. But the making of it was splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come over as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses to me all the way down to Loverâ\\x80\\x99s Lane.

Well, her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from school and stay all night with her. And her cousins are coming over from Newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the Debating Club concert at the hall tomorrow night. And they are going to take Diana and me to the concert--if youâ\\x80\\x99ll let me go, that is. You will, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you, Marilla? Oh, I feel so excited.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

It isnâ\\x80\\x99t as if birthdays were common things, Marilla. Prissy Andrews is going to recite â\\x80\\x98Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight.â\\x80\\x99 That is such a good moral piece, Marilla, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure it would do me lots of good to hear it. And the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns. And oh, Marilla, the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is; heâ\\x80\\x99s going to give an address. That will be just about the same thing as a sermon. Please, maynâ\\x80\\x99t I go, Marilla?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

But I donâ\\x80\\x99t approve of this concert plan. Sheâ\\x80\\x99d go there and catch cold like as not, and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement. It would unsettle her for a week.

              "  'â\\x80\\x9cI think you ought to let Anne go,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Matthew firmly. Argument was not his strong point, but holding fast to his opinion certainly was.

Oh, Marilla, my heart was just set on going to that concert. I never was to a concert in my life, and when the other girls talk about them in school I feel so out of it. You didnâ\\x80\\x99t know just how I felt about it, but you see Matthew did. Matthew understands me, and itâ\\x80\\x99s so nice to be understood, Marilla.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

The Avonlea Debating Club, which met fortnightly all winter, had had several smaller free entertainments; but this was to be a big affair, admission ten cents, in aid of the library. The Avonlea young people had been practicing for weeks, and all the scholars were especially interested in it by reason of older brothers and sisters who were going to take part. Everybody in school over nine years of age expected to go, except Carrie Sloane, whose father shared Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s opinions about small girls going out to night concerts. Carrie Sloane cried into her grammar all the afternoon and felt that life was not worth living.',\n",

They had a â\\x80\\x9cperfectly elegant tea;â\\x80\\x9d and then came the delicious occupation of dressing in Dianaâ\\x80\\x99s little room upstairs. Diana did Anneâ\\x80\\x99s front hair in the new pompadour style and Anne tied Dianaâ\\x80\\x99s bows with the especial knack she possessed; and they experimented with at least half a dozen different ways of arranging their back hair. At last they were ready, cheeks scarlet and eyes glowing with excitement.',\n",

Anne reveled in the drive to the hall, slipping along over the satin-smooth roads with the snow crisping under the runners. There was a magnificent sunset, and the snowy hills and deep-blue water of the St. Lawrence Gulf seemed to rim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with wine and fire. Tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter, that seemed like the mirth of wood elves, came from every quarter.',\n",

Away up in the barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloaneâ\\x80\\x99s place, the Mayflowers blossomed out, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves.

I think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot. Charlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t take a dare.

I was offered some Mayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn. I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you the personâ\\x80\\x99s name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We made wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the time came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two, with our bouquets and wreaths, singing â\\x80\\x98My Home on the Hill.â\\x80\\x99 Oh, it was so thrilling, Marilla.

I did pretty well until I put the pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed. So that is how I came to forget the pie. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know I starched the handkerchiefs. All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a name for a new island Diana and I have discovered up the brook. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the most ravishing spot, Marilla.

Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries. She appears when there is to be a death in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand--so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. And thereâ\\x80\\x99s a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t go through the Haunted Wood after dark now for anything. Iâ\\x80\\x99d be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

A white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still.

The swoop of bats in the darkness over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures.

Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didnâ\\x80\\x99t cry--because she hadnâ\\x80\\x99t brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh, Marilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning, â\\x80\\x98The time has come for us to part.â\\x80\\x99 It was very affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times Iâ\\x80\\x99d talked in school and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy. I can tell you I wished Iâ\\x80\\x99d been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She hadnâ\\x80\\x99t anything on her conscience. The girls cried all the way home from school. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, â\\x80\\x98The time has come for us to part,â\\x80\\x99 and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one canâ\\x80\\x99t feel quite in the depths of despair with two monthsâ\\x80\\x99 vacation before them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t help taking a little interest in a new minister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely, of course--it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally lovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably. Our new ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses. Jane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t make any such uncharitable remark, Marilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides, sheâ\\x80\\x99s only been a ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife for a little while, so one should make allowances, shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse is ready.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'If Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lyndeâ\\x80\\x99s that evening, was actuated by any motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had borrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most of the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes never expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the borrowers thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife, was a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement where sensations were few and far between.',\n",
              "  'Old Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in imagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a widower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that gossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year of his sojourn. In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and departed amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection born of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his shortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a variety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various candidates and â\\x80\\x9csuppliesâ\\x80\\x9d who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on trial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers in Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the corner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and discussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from principle to criticize ministers in any shape or form.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthewâ\\x80\\x9d was Anneâ\\x80\\x99s final summing up. â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his worst fault was just like Mr. Bentleyâ\\x80\\x99s--he had no imagination. And Mr. Terry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in the matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology wasnâ\\x80\\x99t sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man, but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church; he was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister, mustnâ\\x80\\x99t you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive; but Mrs. Lynde says he isnâ\\x80\\x99t married, or even engaged, because she made special inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have a young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the congregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing woman, isnâ\\x80\\x99t she, Matthew? Iâ\\x80\\x99m very glad theyâ\\x80\\x99ve called Mr. Allan. I liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it. Mrs. Lynde says he isnâ\\x80\\x99t perfect, but she says she supposes we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year, and anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly on all the points of doctrine. And she knows his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s people and they are most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde says that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman make an ideal combination for a ministerâ\\x80\\x99s family.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'The new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still on their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for their chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start. Old and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals, and the bright, gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the manse. With Mrs. Allan Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love. She had discovered another kindred spirit.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Allan is perfectly lovely,â\\x80\\x9d she announced one Sunday afternoon. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s taken our class and sheâ\\x80\\x99s a splendid teacher. She said right away she didnâ\\x80\\x99t think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions, and you know, Marilla, that is exactly what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always thought. She said we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many. Iâ\\x80\\x99m good at asking questions, Marilla.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cI believe youâ\\x80\\x9d was Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s emphatic comment.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cNobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was to be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t think that was a very proper question to ask because it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t any connection with the lesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lionsâ\\x80\\x99 den--but Mrs. Allan just smiled and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a lovely smile; she has such _exquisite_ dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had dimples in my cheeks, Marilla. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not half so skinny as I was when I came here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence people for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence other people for good. She talked so nice about everything. I never knew before that religion was such a cheerful thing. I always thought it was kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allanâ\\x80\\x99s isnâ\\x80\\x99t, and Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to be a Christian if I could be one like her. I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want to be one like Mr. Superintendent Bell.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell,â\\x80\\x9d said Marilla severely. â\\x80\\x9cMr. Bell is a real good man.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, of course heâ\\x80\\x99s good,â\\x80\\x9d agreed Anne, â\\x80\\x9cbut he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to get any comfort out of it. If I could be good Iâ\\x80\\x99d dance and sing all day because I was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and of course it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be dignified in a ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife. But I can just feel sheâ\\x80\\x99s glad sheâ\\x80\\x99s a Christian and that sheâ\\x80\\x99d be one even if she could get to heaven without it.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cI suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon,â\\x80\\x9d said Marilla reflectively. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99ve been most everywhere but here. Let me see. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But donâ\\x80\\x99t say a word to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming heâ\\x80\\x99d find some excuse to be away that day. Heâ\\x80\\x99d got so used to Mr. Bentley he didnâ\\x80\\x99t mind him, but heâ\\x80\\x99s going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new minister, and a new ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife will frighten him to death.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be as secret as the dead,â\\x80\\x9d assured Anne. â\\x80\\x9cBut oh, Marilla, will you let me make a cake for the occasion? Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to do something for Mrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cYou can make a layer cake,â\\x80\\x9d promised Marilla.',\n",
              "  'Monday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables. Having the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important undertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of the Avonlea housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She talked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they sat on the big red stones by the Dryadâ\\x80\\x99s Bubble and made rainbows in the water with little twigs dipped in fir balsam.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cEverything is ready, Diana, except my cake which Iâ\\x80\\x99m to make in the morning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just before teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy two days of it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s such a responsibility having a ministerâ\\x80\\x99s family to tea. I never went through such an experience before. You should just see our pantry. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a sight to behold. Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to have jellied chicken and cold tongue. Weâ\\x80\\x99re to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and whipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies, and fruit cake, and Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s famous yellow plum preserves that she keeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and biscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister is dyspeptic and canâ\\x80\\x99t eat new. Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to have had a bad effect on him. I just grow cold when I think of my layer cake. Oh, Diana, what if it shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be good! I dreamed last night that I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99ll be good, all right,â\\x80\\x9d assured Diana, who was a very comfortable sort of friend. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure that piece of the one you made that we had for lunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cYes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when you especially want them to be good,â\\x80\\x9d sighed Anne, setting a particularly well-balsamed twig afloat. â\\x80\\x9cHowever, I suppose I shall just have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour. Oh, look, Diana, what a lovely rainbow! Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cYou know there is no such thing as a dryad,â\\x80\\x9d said Diana. Dianaâ\\x80\\x99s mother had found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over it. As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of belief even in harmless dryads.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s so easy to imagine there is,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne. â\\x80\\x9cEvery night before I go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes I look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, donâ\\x80\\x99t give up your faith in the dryad!â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Wednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too excited to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of her dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short of absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary matters that morning. After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake. When she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure I havenâ\\x80\\x99t forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you think it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isnâ\\x80\\x99t good? I used it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated. Mrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says weâ\\x80\\x99ll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what if that cake doesnâ\\x80\\x99t rise?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll have plenty without itâ\\x80\\x9d was Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s unimpassioned way of looking at the subject.',\n",
              "  'The cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and feathery as golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together with layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it and possibly asking for another piece!',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cCan I fix the table with ferns and wild roses?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cI think thatâ\\x80\\x99s all nonsense,â\\x80\\x9d sniffed Marilla. â\\x80\\x9cIn my opinion itâ\\x80\\x99s the eatables that matter and not flummery decorations.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Barry had _her_ table decorated,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne, who was not entirely guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, â\\x80\\x9cand the minister paid her an elegant compliment. He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the palate.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell, do as you like,â\\x80\\x9d said Marilla, who was quite determined not to be surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. â\\x80\\x9cOnly mind you leave enough room for the dishes and the food.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Anne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that should leave Mrs. Barryâ\\x80\\x99s nowhere.

              "  'Matthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness and Anne knew how. He had been in such a state of shyness and nervousness that Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him in hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly. He never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be expected.',\n",
              "  'All went merry as a marriage bell until Anneâ\\x80\\x99s layer cake was passed. Mrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety, declined it. But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anneâ\\x80\\x99s face, said smilingly:',\n",

              "  'â\\x80\\x9cNo, Marilla, but oh, what do you think? I am invited to tea at the manse tomorrow afternoon! Mrs. Allan left the letter for me at the post office. Just look at it, Marilla. â\\x80\\x98Miss Anne Shirley, Green Gables.â\\x80\\x99 That is the first time I was ever called â\\x80\\x98Miss.â\\x80\\x99 Such a thrill as it gave me! I shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Allan told me she meant to have all the members of her Sunday-school class to tea in turn,â\\x80\\x9d said Marilla, regarding the wonderful event very coolly. â\\x80\\x9cYou neednâ\\x80\\x99t get in such a fever over it. Do learn to take things calmly, child.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'For Anne to take things calmly would have been to change her nature. All â\\x80\\x9cspirit and fire and dew,â\\x80\\x9d as she was, the pleasures and pains of life came to her with trebled intensity. Marilla felt this and was vaguely troubled over it, realizing that the ups and downs of existence would probably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently understanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more than compensate. Therefore Marilla conceived it to be her duty to drill Anne into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien to her as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows. She did not make much headway, as she sorrowfully admitted to herself. The downfall of some dear hope or plan plunged Anne into â\\x80\\x9cdeeps of affliction.â\\x80\\x9d The fulfillment thereof exalted her to dizzy realms of delight. Marilla had almost begun to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into her model little girl of demure manners and prim deportment. Neither would she have believed that she really liked Anne much better as she was.',\n",
              "  'Anne went to bed that night speechless with misery because Matthew had said the wind was round northeast and he feared it would be a rainy day tomorrow. The rustle of the poplar leaves about the house worried her, it sounded so like pattering raindrops, and the full, faraway roar of the gulf, to which she listened delightedly at other times, loving its strange, sonorous, haunting rhythm, now seemed like a prophecy of storm and disaster to a small maiden who particularly wanted a fine day. Anne thought that the morning would never come.',\n",
              "  'But all things have an end, even nights before the day on which you are invited to take tea at the manse. The morning, in spite of Matthewâ\\x80\\x99s predictions, was fine and Anneâ\\x80\\x99s spirits soared to their highest. â\\x80\\x9cOh, Marilla, there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody I see,â\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t know how good I feel! Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be nice if it could last? I believe I could be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every day. But oh, Marilla, itâ\\x80\\x99s a solemn occasion too. I feel so anxious. What if I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t behave properly? You know I never had tea at a manse before, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure that I know all the rules of etiquette, although Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been studying the rules given in the Etiquette Department of the Family Herald ever since I came here. Iâ\\x80\\x99m so afraid Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do something silly or forget to do something I should do. Would it be good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to _very_ much?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cThe trouble with you, Anne, is that youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking too much about yourself. You should just think of Mrs. Allan and what would be nicest and most agreeable to her,â\\x80\\x9d said Marilla, hitting for once in her life on a very sound and pithy piece of advice. Anne instantly realized this.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cYou are right, Marilla. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll try not to think about myself at all.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Anne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of â\\x80\\x9cetiquette,â\\x80\\x9d for she came home through the twilight, under a great, high-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in a beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting on the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly head in Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s gingham lap.',\n",
              "  'A cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims of firry western hills and whistling through the poplars. One clear star hung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Loverâ\\x80\\x99s Lane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. Anne watched them as she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were all tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, Marilla, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a most _fascinating_ time. I feel that I have not lived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never be invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me at the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy, with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a seraph. I really think Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to be a ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife when I grow up, Marilla. A minister mightnâ\\x80\\x99t mind my red hair because he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be thinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to be naturally good and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never be that, so I suppose thereâ\\x80\\x99s no use in thinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others are not. Iâ\\x80\\x99m one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says Iâ\\x80\\x99m full of original sin. No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success of it as those who are naturally good. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a good deal like geometry, I expect. But donâ\\x80\\x99t you think the trying so hard ought to count for something? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her passionately. You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs. Allan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are others, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. You know you _ought_ to love them because they know so much and are such active workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget. There was another little girl at the manse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday school. Her name was Laurette Bradley, and she was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a kindred spirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I think I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs. Allan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too. Mrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the Sunday-school choir after this. You canâ\\x80\\x99t think how I was thrilled at the mere thought. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir, as Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to. Lauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the White Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it. Lauretta says that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White Sands people to recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself someday. I just gazed at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I had a heart-to-heart talk. I told her everything--about Mrs. Thomas and the twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and my troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs. Allan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. You donâ\\x80\\x99t know how that encouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what do you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and itâ\\x80\\x99s a lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that a romantic name? Mrs. Lynde says theyâ\\x80\\x99ve never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid to have a lady teacher, and I really donâ\\x80\\x99t see how Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to live through the two weeks before school begins. Iâ\\x80\\x99m so impatient to see her.â\\x80\\x9d'],\n",

Not a kindred spirit, of course; but still I like him and Iâ\\x80\\x99m awfully sorry I ever criticized his prayers. I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into the habit of saying them as if he didnâ\\x80\\x99t. He could get over that if heâ\\x80\\x99d take a little trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard I tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. He told me all about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy.

Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen times. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that something to be proud of, Marilla? When a ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife has so many claims on her time! She is such a cheerful person to have visit you, too. She never tells you itâ\\x80\\x99s your own fault and she hopes youâ\\x80\\x99ll be a better girl on account of it.

Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received her as politely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk a ridgepole.

Diana says she has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses beautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody elseâ\\x80\\x99s in Avonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, itâ\\x80\\x99s just glorious to think of it. Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie has so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are preparing a dialogue, called â\\x80\\x98A Morning Visit,â\\x80\\x99 for next Friday. And the Friday afternoons they donâ\\x80\\x99t have recitations Miss Stacy takes them all to the woods for a â\\x80\\x98fieldâ\\x80\\x99 day and they study ferns and flowers and birds. And they have physical culture exercises every morning and evening. Mrs. Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all comes of having a lady teacher.

              "  'In the new teacher she found another true and helpful friend. Miss Stacy was a bright, sympathetic young woman with the happy gift of winning and holding the affections of her pupils and bringing out the best that was in them mentally and morally. Anne expanded like a flower under this wholesome influence and carried home to the admiring Matthew and the critical Marilla glowing accounts of schoolwork and aims.',\n",

When she pronounces my name I feel _instinctively_ that sheâ\\x80\\x99s spelling it with an E. We had recitations this afternoon. I just wish you could have been there to hear me recite â\\x80\\x98Mary, Queen of Scots.â\\x80\\x99 I just put my whole soul into it. Ruby Gillis told me coming home that the way I said the line, â\\x80\\x98Now for my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s arm,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98my womanâ\\x80\\x99s heart farewell,â\\x80\\x99 just made her blood run cold.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

It wonâ\\x80\\x99t be so exciting as it is when you have a whole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your words.

And Miss Stacy explains everything so beautifully. We have to write compositions on our field afternoons and I write the best ones.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s very vain of you to say so then. Youâ\\x80\\x99d better let your teacher say it.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cBut she _did_ say it, Marilla. And indeed Iâ\\x80\\x99m not vain about it. How can I be, when Iâ\\x80\\x99m such a dunce at geometry? Although Iâ\\x80\\x99m really beginning to see through it a little, too. Miss Stacy makes it so clear. Still, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never be good at it and I assure you it is a humbling reflection. But I love writing compositions. Mostly Miss Stacy lets us choose our own subjects; but next week we are to write a composition on some remarkable person. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to choose among so many remarkable people who have lived. Mustnâ\\x80\\x99t it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after youâ\\x80\\x99re dead? Oh, I would dearly love to be remarkable. I think when I grow up Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be a trained nurse and go with the Red Crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of mercy. That is, if I donâ\\x80\\x99t go out as a foreign missionary. That would be very romantic, but one would have to be very good to be a missionary, and that would be a stumbling block. We have physical culture exercises every day, too. They make you graceful and promote digestion.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

              "  'But all the field afternoons and recitation Fridays and physical culture contortions paled before a project which Miss Stacy brought forward in November. This was that the scholars of Avonlea school should get up a concert and hold it in the hall on Christmas Night, for the laudable purpose of helping to pay for a schoolhouse flag. The pupils one and all taking graciously to this plan, the preparations for a program were begun at once. And of all the excited performers-elect none was so excited as Anne Shirley, who threw herself into the undertaking heart and soul, hampered as she was by Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s disapproval. Marilla thought it all rank foolishness.',\n",

Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to have six choruses and Diana is to sing a solo. Iâ\\x80\\x99m in two dialogues--â\\x80\\x98The Society for the Suppression of Gossipâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98The Fairy Queen.â\\x80\\x99 The boys are going to have a dialogue too. And Iâ\\x80\\x99m to have two recitations, Marilla. I just tremble when I think of it, but itâ\\x80\\x99s a nice thrilly kind of tremble. And weâ\\x80\\x99re to have a tableau at the last--â\\x80\\x98Faith, Hope and Charity.â\\x80\\x99 Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with flowing hair. Iâ\\x80\\x99m to be Hope, with my hands clasped--so--and my eyes uplifted. Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to practice my recitations in the garret. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be alarmed if you hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one of them, and itâ\\x80\\x99s really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla. Josie Pye is sulky because she didnâ\\x80\\x99t get the part she wanted in the dialogue. She wanted to be the fairy queen. That would have been ridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy queens must be slender. Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be one of her maids of honor. Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie says. Iâ\\x80\\x99m to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis is going to lend me her slippers because I havenâ\\x80\\x99t any of my own. Itâ\\x80\\x99s necessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. You couldnâ\\x80\\x99t imagine a fairy wearing boots, could you? Especially with copper toes? We are going to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with pink tissue-paper roses in them. And we are all to march in two by two after the audience is seated, while Emma White plays a march on the organ. Oh, Marilla, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am, but donâ\\x80\\x99t you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cAll I hope is that youâ\\x80\\x99ll behave yourself. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be heartily glad when all this fuss is over and youâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to settle down. You are simply good for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues and groans and tableaus. As for your tongue, itâ\\x80\\x99s a marvel itâ\\x80\\x99s not clean worn out.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Anne perched herself on a block and talked the concert over with him, sure of an appreciative and sympathetic listener in this instance at least.',\n",

And I expect youâ\\x80\\x99ll do your part fine,â\\x80\\x9d he said, smiling down into her eager, vivacious little face. Anne smiled back at him. Those two were the best of friends and Matthew thanked his stars many a time and oft that he had nothing to do with bringing her up. That was Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s exclusive duty; if it had been his he would have been worried over frequent conflicts between inclination and said duty. As it was, he was free to, â\\x80\\x9cspoil Anneâ\\x80\\x9d--Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s phrasing--as much as he liked. But it was not such a bad arrangement after all; a little â\\x80\\x9cappreciationâ\\x80\\x9d sometimes does quite as much good as all the conscientious â\\x80\\x9cbringing upâ\\x80\\x9d in the world.'],\n",

              "  '|MATTHEW was having a bad ten minutes of it. He had come into the kitchen, in the twilight of a cold, gray December evening, and had sat down in the woodbox corner to take off his heavy boots, unconscious of the fact that Anne and a bevy of her schoolmates were having a practice of â\\x80\\x9cThe Fairy Queenâ\\x80\\x9d in the sitting room. Presently they came trooping through the hall and out into the kitchen, laughing and chattering gaily. They did not see Matthew, who shrank bashfully back into the shadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack in the other, and he watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minutes as they put on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert. Anne stood among them, bright eyed and animated as they; but Matthew suddenly became conscious that there was something about her different from her mates. And what worried Matthew was that the difference impressed him as being something that should not exist. Anne had a brighter face, and bigger, starrier eyes, and more delicate features than the other; even shy, unobservant Matthew had learned to take note of these things; but the difference that disturbed him did not consist in any of these respects. Then in what did it consist?',\n",
              "  'Matthew was haunted by this question long after the girls had gone, arm in arm, down the long, hard-frozen lane and Anne had betaken herself to her books. He could not refer it to Marilla, who, he felt, would be quite sure to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she saw between Anne and the other girls was that they sometimes kept their tongues quiet while Anne never did. This, Matthew felt, would be no great help.',\n",
              "  'He had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out, much to Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s disgust. After two hours of smoking and hard reflection Matthew arrived at a solution of his problem. Anne was not dressed like the other girls!',\n",
              "  'The more Matthew thought about the matter the more he was convinced that Anne never had been dressed like the other girls--never since she had come to Green Gables. Marilla kept her clothed in plain, dark dresses, all made after the same unvarying pattern. If Matthew knew there was such a thing as fashion in dress it was as much as he did; but he was quite sure that Anneâ\\x80\\x99s sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the other girls wore. He recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen around her that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue and pink and white--and he wondered why Marilla always kept her so plainly and soberly gowned.',\n",
              "  'Of course, it must be all right. Marilla knew best and Marilla was bringing her up. Probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served thereby. But surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty dress--something like Diana Barry always wore. Matthew decided that he would give her one; that surely could not be objected to as an unwarranted putting in of his oar. Christmas was only a fortnight off. A nice new dress would be the very thing for a present. Matthew, with a sigh of satisfaction, put away his pipe and went to bed, while Marilla opened all the doors and aired the house.',\n",
              "  'The very next evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody to buy the dress, determined to get the worst over and have done with it. It would be, he felt assured, no trifling ordeal. There were some things Matthew could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he would be at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girlâ\\x80\\x99s dress.',\n",
              "  'After much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawsonâ\\x80\\x99s store instead of William Blairâ\\x80\\x99s. To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to William Blairâ\\x80\\x99s; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them as to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But William Blairâ\\x80\\x99s two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew held them in absolute dread. He could contrive to deal with them when he knew exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter as this, requiring explanation and consultation, Matthew felt that he must be sure of a man behind the counter. So he would go to Lawsonâ\\x80\\x99s, where Samuel or his son would wait on him.',\n",
              "  'Alas! Matthew did not know that Samuel, in the recent expansion of his business, had set up a lady clerk also; she was a niece of his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s and a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping pompadour, big, rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and bewildering smile. She was dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets that glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands. Matthew was covered with confusion at finding her there at all; and those bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWhat can I do for you this evening, Mr. Cuthbert?â\\x80\\x9d Miss Lucilla Harris inquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, tapping the counter with both hands.',\n",

To Mrs. Lynde he went accordingly, and that good lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed manâ\\x80\\x99s hands.',\n",

No? Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just go by my own judgment then. I believe a nice rich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has some new gloria in thatâ\\x80\\x99s real pretty. Perhaps youâ\\x80\\x99d like me to make it up for her, too, seeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise? Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it. No, it isnâ\\x80\\x99t a mite of trouble. I like sewing. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll make it to fit my niece, Jenny Gillis, for she and Anne are as like as two peas as far as figure goes.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Iâ\\x80\\x99ve held my tongue though, for I can see Marilla doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all sheâ\\x80\\x99s an old maid. But thatâ\\x80\\x99s always the way. Folks that has brought up children know that thereâ\\x80\\x99s no hard and fast method in the world thatâ\\x80\\x99ll suit every child. But them as never have think itâ\\x80\\x99s all as plain and easy as Rule of Three--just set your three terms down so fashion, and the sum â\\x80\\x98ll work out correct. But flesh and blood donâ\\x80\\x99t come under the head of arithmetic and thatâ\\x80\\x99s where Marilla Cuthbert makes her mistake. I suppose sheâ\\x80\\x99s trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in Anne by dressing her as she does; but itâ\\x80\\x99s more likely to cultivate envy and discontent. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other girlsâ\\x80\\x99. But to think of Matthew taking notice of it!

Well, I must say I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Anne needed any more dresses. I made her three good, warm, serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer extravagance. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s enough material in those sleeves alone to make a waist, I declare there is. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll just pamper Anneâ\\x80\\x99s vanity, Matthew, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s as vain as a peacock now. Well, I hope sheâ\\x80\\x99ll be satisfied at last, for I know sheâ\\x80\\x99s been hankering after those silly sleeves ever since they came in, although she never said a word after the first.

It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel that I ought to be a very good girl indeed. Itâ\\x80\\x99s at times like this Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will be in future.

He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a carriage, and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three miles; because, you understand, the carriage was all smashed up. I found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to go by. I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because I thought sheâ\\x80\\x99d likely be an authority on the subject, having so many sisters married. Ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when Malcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan. She said Malcolm told Susan that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, â\\x80\\x98What do you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?â\\x80\\x99 And Susan said, â\\x80\\x98Yes--no--I donâ\\x80\\x99t know--let me seeâ\\x80\\x99--and there they were, engaged as quick as that. But I didnâ\\x80\\x99t think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could. I made it very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees, although Ruby Gillis says it isnâ\\x80\\x99t done nowadays. Geraldine accepted him in a speech a page long. I can tell you I took a lot of trouble with that speech. I rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my masterpiece. Bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace and told her they would go to Europe for a wedding tour, for he was immensely wealthy. But then, alas, shadows began to darken over their path. Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram herself and when Geraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious, especially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring. All her affection for Geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she should never marry Bertram. But she pretended to be Geraldineâ\\x80\\x99s friend the same as ever. One evening they were standing on the bridge over a rushing turbulent stream and Cordelia, thinking they were alone, pushed Geraldine over the brink with a wild, mocking, â\\x80\\x98Ha, ha, ha.â\\x80\\x99 But Bertram saw it all and he at once plunged into the current, exclaiming, â\\x80\\x98I will save thee, my peerless Geraldine.â\\x80\\x99 But alas, he had forgotten he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each otherâ\\x80\\x99s arms. Their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana. Itâ\\x80\\x99s so much more romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding. As for Cordelia, she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum. I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll help you along until you can do them by yourself. You ought to cultivate your imagination, you know.

We are going to keep them all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants. We each write under a nom-de-plume. Mine is Rosamond Montmorency. All the girls do pretty well. Ruby Gillis is rather sentimental. She puts too much lovemaking into her stories and you know too much is worse than too little. Jane never puts any because she says it makes her feel so silly when she had to read it out loud. Janeâ\\x80\\x99s stories are extremely sensible. Then Diana puts too many murders into hers. She says most of the time she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do with the people so she kills them off to get rid of them.

All the good people are rewarded and all the bad ones are suitably punished. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure that must have a wholesome effect. The moral is the great thing. Mr. Allan says so. I read one of my stories to him and Mrs. Allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent. Only they laughed in the wrong places. I like it better when people cry. Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic parts. Diana wrote her Aunt Josephine about our club and her Aunt Josephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories. So we copied out four of our very best and sent them. Miss Josephine Barry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life. That kind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost everybody died. But Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad Miss Barry liked them. It shows our club is doing some good in the world. Mrs. Allan says that ought to be our object in everything. I do really try to make it my object but I forget so often when Iâ\\x80\\x99m having fun. I hope I shall be a little like Mrs. Allan when I grow up. Do you think there is any prospect of it, Marilla?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

I felt so encouraged when I heard that. Is it very wicked of me, Marilla, to feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and mischievous? Mrs. Lynde says it is. Mrs. Lynde says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty, no matter how small they were. Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that when he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his auntâ\\x80\\x99s pantry and she never had any respect for that minister again. Now, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have felt that way. Iâ\\x80\\x99d have thought that it was real noble of him to confess it, and Iâ\\x80\\x99d have thought what an encouraging thing it would be for small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them to know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s how Iâ\\x80\\x99d feel, Marilla.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings. She probably imagined that she was thinking about the Aids and their missionary box and the new carpet for the vestry room, but under these reflections was a harmonious consciousness of red fields smoking into pale-purply mists in the declining sun, of long, sharp-pointed fir shadows falling over the meadow beyond the brook, of still, crimson-budded maples around a mirrorlike wood pool, of a wakening in the world and a stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod. The spring was abroad in the land and Marillaâ\\x80\\x99s sober, middle-aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep, primal gladness.',\n",
              "  'Her eyes dwelt affectionately on Green Gables, peering through its network of trees and reflecting the sunlight back from its windows in several little coruscations of glory. Marilla, as she picked her steps along the damp lane, thought that it was really a satisfaction to know that she was going home to a briskly snapping wood fire and a table nicely spread for tea, instead of to the cold comfort of old Aid meeting evenings before Anne had come to Green Gables.',\n",
              "  'Consequently, when Marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black out, with no sign of Anne anywhere, she felt justly disappointed and irritated. She had told Anne to be sure and have tea ready at five oâ\\x80\\x99clock, but now she must hurry to take off her second-best dress and prepare the meal herself against Matthewâ\\x80\\x99s return from plowing.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll settle Miss Anne when she comes home,â\\x80\\x9d said Marilla grimly, as she shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was strictly necessary. Matthew had come in and was waiting patiently for his tea in his corner. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s gadding off somewhere with Diana, writing stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery, and never thinking once about the time or her duties. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s just got to be pulled up short and sudden on this sort of thing. I donâ\\x80\\x99t care if Mrs. Allan does say sheâ\\x80\\x99s the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew. She may be bright and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and thereâ\\x80\\x99s never any knowing what shape itâ\\x80\\x99ll break out in next. Just as soon as she grows out of one freak she takes up with another. But there! Here I am saying the very thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at the Aid today. I was real glad when Mrs. Allan spoke up for Anne, for if she hadnâ\\x80\\x99t I know Iâ\\x80\\x99d have said something too sharp to Rachel before everybody. Anneâ\\x80\\x99s got plenty of faults, goodness knows, and far be it from me to deny it. But Iâ\\x80\\x99m bringing her up and not Rachel Lynde, whoâ\\x80\\x99d pick faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea. Just the same, Anne has no business to leave the house like this when I told her she was to stay home this afternoon and look after things. I must say, with all her faults, I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and Iâ\\x80\\x99m real sorry to find her so now.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Donâ\\x80\\x99t call her untrustworthy until youâ\\x80\\x99re sure she has disobeyed you. Mebbe it can all be explained--Anneâ\\x80\\x99s a great hand at explaining.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been expecting something queer for some time. You havenâ\\x80\\x99t got into any scrape for over two months, and I was sure another one was due.

He said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black--he positively assured me that it would. How could I doubt his word, Marilla? I know what it feels like to have your word doubted. And Mrs. Allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that theyâ\\x80\\x99re not. I have proof now--green hair is proof enough for anybody.

              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t let him in the house. I remembered what you told me, and I went out, carefully shut the door, and looked at his things on the step. Besides, he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t an Italian--he was a German Jew. He had a big box full of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to make enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany. He spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart. I wanted to buy something from him to help him in such a worthy object. Then all at once I saw the bottle of hair dye. The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t wash off. In a trice I saw myself with beautiful raven-black hair and the temptation was irresistible. But the price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I had only fifty cents left out of my chicken money. I think the peddler had a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it was me, heâ\\x80\\x99d sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away. So I bought it, and as soon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush as the directions said. I used up the whole bottle, and oh, Marilla, when I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being wicked, I can tell you. And Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been repenting ever since.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell, I hope youâ\\x80\\x99ll repent to good purpose,â\\x80\\x9d said Marilla severely, â\\x80\\x9cand that youâ\\x80\\x99ve got your eyes opened to where your vanity has led you, Anne. Goodness knows whatâ\\x80\\x99s to be done. I suppose the first thing is to give your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Accordingly, Anne washed her hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water, but for all the difference it made she might as well have been scouring its original red.

People have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes--the liniment cake and setting Diana drunk and flying into a temper with Mrs. Lynde. But theyâ\\x80\\x99ll never forget this. They will think I am not respectable. Oh, Marilla, â\\x80\\x98what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.â\\x80\\x99 That is poetry, but it is true.

The girls in books lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good deed, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind losing my hair in some such fashion half so much. But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because youâ\\x80\\x99ve dyed it a dreadful color, is there?

And I wonâ\\x80\\x99t try to imagine it away, either. I never thought I was vain about my hair, of all things, but now I know I was, in spite of its being red, because it was so long and thick and curly.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and I wanted to say something back. But I didnâ\\x80\\x99t. I just swept her one scornful look and then I forgave her.

Of course itâ\\x80\\x99s better to be good. I know it is, but itâ\\x80\\x99s sometimes so hard to believe a thing even when you know it. I do really want to be good, Marilla, like you and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy, and grow up to be a credit to you. Diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side. She says she thinks it will be very becoming.

Idlewild was a thing of the past, Mr. Bell having ruthlessly cut down the little circle of trees in his back pasture in the spring. Anne had sat among the stumps and wept, not without an eye to the romance of it; but she was speedily consoled, for, after all, as she and Diana said, big girls of thirteen, going on fourteen, were too old for such childish amusements as playhouses, and there were more fascinating sports to be found about the pond. It was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat-bottomed dory Mr. Barry kept for duck shooting.',\n",

              "  'The black shawl having been procured, Anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, she does look really dead,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Ruby Gillis nervously, watching the still, white little face under the flickering shadows of the birches. â\\x80\\x9cIt makes me feel frightened, girls. Do you suppose itâ\\x80\\x99s really right to act like this? Mrs. Lynde says that all play-acting is abominably wicked.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cRuby, you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t talk about Mrs. Lynde,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne severely. â\\x80\\x9cIt spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before Mrs. Lynde was born. Jane, you arrange this. Itâ\\x80\\x99s silly for Elaine to be talking when sheâ\\x80\\x99s dead.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Jane rose to the occasion. Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none, but an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent substitute.

Anne, for goodness sake smile a little. You know Elaine â\\x80\\x98lay as though she smiled.â\\x80\\x99 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s better. Now push the flat off.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'The flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old embedded stake in the process. Diana and Jane and Ruby only waited long enough to see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before scampering up through the woods, across the road, and down to the lower headland where, as Lancelot and Guinevere and the King, they were to be in readiness to receive the lily maid.',\n",
              "  'For a few minutes Anne, drifting slowly down, enjoyed the romance of her situation to the full. Then something happened not at all romantic. The flat began to leak. In a very few moments it was necessary for Elaine to scramble to her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall of blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her barge through which the water was literally pouring. That sharp stake at the landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat. Anne did not know this, but it did not take her long to realize that she was in a dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland. Where were the oars? Left behind at the landing!',\n",
              "  'Anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard; she was white to the lips, but she did not lose her self-possession. There was one chance--just one.',\n",

I prayed, Mrs. Allan, most earnestly, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it. You know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them. It was proper to pray, but I had to do my part by watching out and right well I knew it. I just said, â\\x80\\x98Dear God, please take the flat close to a pile and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do the rest,â\\x80\\x99 over and over again. Under such circumstances you donâ\\x80\\x99t think much about making a flowery prayer. But mine was answered, for the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf and the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential stub. And there I was, Mrs. Allan, clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down. It was a very unromantic position, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t think about that at the time. You donâ\\x80\\x99t think much about romance when you have just escaped from a watery grave. I said a grateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to holding on tight, for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to get back to dry land.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'The flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream. Ruby, Jane, and Diana, already awaiting it on the lower headland, saw it disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that Anne had gone down with it. For a moment they stood still, white as sheets, frozen with horror at the tragedy; then, shrieking at the tops of their voices, they started on a frantic run up through the woods, never pausing as they crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge. Anne, clinging desperately to her precarious foothold, saw their flying forms and heard their shrieks. Help would soon come, but meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one.',\n",
              "  'The minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid. Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t somebody come? Where had the girls gone? Suppose they had fainted, one and all! Suppose nobody ever came! Suppose she grew so tired and cramped that she could hold on no longer! Anne looked at the wicked green depths below her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and shivered. Her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her.',\n",

There was no help for it; Anne, clinging to Gilbert Blytheâ\\x80\\x99s hand, scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious, in the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe.

Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat. But the bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering determination. That scene of two years before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday. Gilbert had called her â\\x80\\x9ccarrotsâ\\x80\\x9d and had brought about her disgrace before the whole school. Her resentment, which to other and older people might be as laughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly. She hated Gilbert Blythe! She would never forgive him!',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d she said coldly, â\\x80\\x9cI shall never be friends with you, Gilbert Blythe; and I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be!â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Altogether, Anne rather thought it would be a relief to sit down and have a good cry. She was really quite unstrung, for the reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.',\n",

Ever since I came to Green Gables Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been making mistakes, and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming. The affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didnâ\\x80\\x99t belong to me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about my hair and nose now--at least, very seldom. And todayâ\\x80\\x99s mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic. I have come to the conclusion that it is no use trying to be romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated now. I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect, Marilla.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

It was a September evening and all the gaps and clearings in the woods were brimmed up with ruby sunset light. Here and there the lane was splashed with it, but for the most part it was already quite shadowy beneath the maples, and the spaces under the firs were filled with a clear violet dusk like airy wine. The winds were out in their tops, and there is no sweeter music on earth than that which the wind makes in the fir trees at evening.',\n",

Marilla always makes my dresses fashionably now, because she says she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t intend to have Matthew going to Mrs. Lynde to make them. Iâ\\x80\\x99m so glad. It is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable. At least, it is easier for me. I suppose it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make such a difference to naturally good people. But Matthew said I must have a new coat, so Marilla bought a lovely piece of blue broadcloth, and itâ\\x80\\x99s being made by a real dressmaker over at Carmody.

But it just slips into my mind in spite of me. My cap is so pretty. Matthew bought it for me the day we were over at Carmody. It is one of those little blue velvet ones that are all the rage, with gold cord and tassels. Your new hat is elegant, Diana, and so becoming. When I saw you come into church last Sunday my heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend. Do you suppose itâ\\x80\\x99s wrong for us to think so much about our clothes?

Sometimes the road went through woods where maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners; sometimes it crossed rivers on bridges that made Anneâ\\x80\\x99s flesh cringe with the old, half-delightful fear; sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed by a little cluster of weather-gray fishing huts; again it mounted to hills whence a far sweep of curving upland or misty-blue sky could be seen; but wherever it went there was much of interest to discuss.

              "  'â\\x80\\x9cIt was splendid,â\\x80\\x9d Anne related to Marilla later on. â\\x80\\x9cI never imagined anything so interesting. I donâ\\x80\\x99t really know which department was the most interesting. I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the fancywork best. Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace. I was real glad she did. And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows Iâ\\x80\\x99m improving, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josieâ\\x80\\x99s success? Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples and Mr. Bell took first prize for a pig. Diana said she thought it was ridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t see why. Do you? She said she would always think of it after this when he was praying so solemnly. Clara Louise MacPherson took a prize for painting, and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter and cheese. So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t it? Mrs. Lynde was there that day, and I never knew how much I really liked her until I saw her familiar face among all those strangers. There were thousands of people there, Marilla. It made me feel dreadfully insignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see the horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t go; she said horse racing was an abomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty to set a good example by staying away. But there were so many there I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe Mrs. Lyndeâ\\x80\\x99s absence would ever be noticed. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think, though, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they _are_ awfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me ten cents that the red horse would win. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t believe he would, but I refused to bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about everything, and I felt sure it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do to tell her that. Itâ\\x80\\x99s always wrong to do anything you canâ\\x80\\x99t tell the ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife. Itâ\\x80\\x99s as good as an extra conscience to have a ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife for your friend. And I was very glad I didnâ\\x80\\x99t bet, because the red horse _did_ win, and I would have lost ten cents. So you see that virtue was its own reward. We saw a man go up in a balloon. Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would be simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him ten cents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you. Miss Barry gave Diana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told. Mine was that I would marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and I would go across water to live. I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after that, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose itâ\\x80\\x99s too early to be looking out for him yet. Oh, it was a never-to-be-forgotten day, Marilla. I was so tired I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t sleep at night. Miss Barry put us in the spare room, according to promise. It was an elegant room, Marilla, but somehow sleeping in a spare room isnâ\\x80\\x99t what I used to think it was. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the worst of growing up, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m beginning to realize it. The things you wanted so much when you were a child donâ\\x80\\x99t seem half so wonderful to you when you get them.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Thursday the girls had a drive in the park, and in the evening Miss Barry took them to a concert in the Academy of Music, where a noted prima donna was to sing. To Anne the evening was a glittering vision of delight.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, Marilla, it was beyond description. I was so excited I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even talk, so you may know what it was like. I just sat in enraptured silence. Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white satin and diamonds. But when she began to sing I never thought about anything else. Oh, I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you how I felt. But it seemed to me that it could never be hard to be good any more. I felt like I do when I look up to the stars. Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears. I was so sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didnâ\\x80\\x99t see how I was ever to return to common life again. She said she thought if we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me. That sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise I found it true. The ice cream was delicious, Marilla, and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock at night. Diana said she believed she was born for city life. Miss Barry asked me what my opinion was, but I said I would have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her what I really thought. So I thought it over after I went to bed. That is the best time to think things out. And I came to the conclusion, Marilla, that I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t born for city life and that I was glad of it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock at night once in a while; but as a regular thing Iâ\\x80\\x99d rather be in the east gable at eleven, sound asleep, but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook. I told Miss Barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed. Miss Barry generally laughed at anything I said, even when I said the most solemn things. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I liked it, Marilla, because I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t trying to be funny. But she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Diana would never have dared to do such a thing and felt rather aghast at Anneâ\\x80\\x99s freedom. But Miss Barry was pleased, and she stood on her veranda and watched the buggy out of sight. Then she went back into her big house with a sigh. It seemed very lonely, lacking those fresh young lives. Miss Barry was a rather selfish old lady, if the truth must be told, and had never cared much for anybody but herself. She valued people only as they were of service to her or amused her. Anne had amused her, and consequently stood high in the old ladyâ\\x80\\x99s good graces.

Behind them the moon was rising out of the sea that grew all radiant and transfigured in her light. Every little cove along the curving road was a marvel of dancing ripples.

She had been reading, but her book had slipped to the floor, and now she was dreaming, with a smile on her parted lips. Glittering castles in Spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and rainbows of her lively fancy; adventures wonderful and enthralling were happening to her in cloudland--adventures that always turned out triumphantly and never involved her in scrapes like those of actual life.',\n",

The lesson of a love that should display itself easily in spoken word and open look was one Marilla could never learn. But she had learned to love this slim, gray-eyed girl with an affection all the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness. Her love made her afraid of being unduly indulgent, indeed. She had an uneasy feeling that it was rather sinful to set oneâ\\x80\\x99s heart so intensely on any human creature as she had set hers on Anne, and perhaps she performed a sort of unconscious penance for this by being stricter and more critical than if the girl had been less dear to her. Certainly Anne herself had no idea how Marilla loved her. She sometimes thought wistfully that Marilla was very hard to please and distinctly lacking in sympathy and understanding.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s lovely in the woods now. All the little wood things--the ferns and the satin leaves and the crackerberries--have gone to sleep, just as if somebody had tucked them away until spring under a blanket of leaves. I think it was a little gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last moonlight night and did it. Diana wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t say much about that, though. Diana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about imagining ghosts into the Haunted Wood. It had a very bad effect on Dianaâ\\x80\\x99s imagination. It blighted it. Mrs. Lynde says Myrtle Bell is a blighted being. I asked Ruby Gillis why Myrtle was blighted, and Ruby said she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her. Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse she is. Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t do to drag them into everything, does it? Diana and I are thinking seriously of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live together forever. Diana hasnâ\\x80\\x99t quite made up her mind though, because she thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild, dashing, wicked young man and reform him. Diana and I talk a great deal about serious subjects now, you know. We feel that we are so much older than we used to be that it isnâ\\x80\\x99t becoming to talk of childish matters. Itâ\\x80\\x99s such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen, Marilla. Miss Stacy took all us girls who are in our teens down to the brook last Wednesday, and talked to us about it. She said we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be too careful what habits we formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens, because by the time we were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation laid for our whole future life. And she said if the foundation was shaky we could never build anything really worth while on it. Diana and I talked the matter over coming home from school. We felt extremely solemn, Marilla. And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible, so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be properly developed. Itâ\\x80\\x99s perfectly appalling to think of being twenty, Marilla. It sounds so fearfully old and grown up. But why was Miss Stacy here this afternoon?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, I know what she was saying. I meant to tell you, Marilla, honestly I did, but I forgot. Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history. Jane Andrews lent it to me. I was reading it at dinner hour, and I had just got to the chariot race when school went in. I was simply wild to know how it turned out--although I felt sure Ben Hur must win, because it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be poetical justice if he didnâ\\x80\\x99t--so I spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and my knee. I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history, you know, while all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur. I was so interested in it that I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at once I just looked up and there she was looking down at me, so reproachful-like. I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla, especially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur away, but she never said a word then. She kept me in at recess and talked to me. She said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I was wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly, I was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead. I had never realized until that moment, Marilla, that what I was doing was deceitful. I was shocked. I cried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and Iâ\\x80\\x99d never do such a thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned out. But Miss Stacy said she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t require that, and she forgave me freely. So I think it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t very kind of her to come up here to you about it after all.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cMiss Stacy never mentioned such a thing to me, Anne, and its only your guilty conscience thatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter with you. You have no business to be taking storybooks to school. You read too many novels anyhow. When I was a girl I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t so much as allowed to look at a novel.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, how can you call Ben Hur a novel when itâ\\x80\\x99s really such a religious book?â\\x80\\x9d protested Anne. â\\x80\\x9cOf course itâ\\x80\\x99s a little too exciting to be proper reading for Sunday, and I only read it on weekdays. And I never read _any_ book now unless either Miss Stacy or Mrs. Allan thinks it is a proper book for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read. Miss Stacy made me promise that. She found me reading a book one day called, The Lurid Mystery of the Haunted Hall. It was one Ruby Gillis had lent me, and, oh, Marilla, it was so fascinating and creepy. It just curdled the blood in my veins. But Miss Stacy said it was a very silly, unwholesome book, and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mind promising not to read any more like it, but it was _agonizing_ to give back that book without knowing how it turned out. But my love for Miss Stacy stood the test and I did. Itâ\\x80\\x99s really wonderful, Marilla, what you can do when youâ\\x80\\x99re truly anxious to please a certain person.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell, I guess Iâ\\x80\\x99ll light the lamp and get to work,â\\x80\\x9d said Marilla. â\\x80\\x9cI see plainly that you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to hear what Miss Stacy had to say.

I know I talk too much, but I am really trying to overcome it, and although I say far too much, yet if you only knew how many things I want to say and donâ\\x80\\x99t, youâ\\x80\\x99d give me some credit for it.

But I didnâ\\x80\\x99t say anything about it, because I supposed it would be perfectly useless. Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to be a teacher. But wonâ\\x80\\x99t it be dreadfully expensive?

Youâ\\x80\\x99ll always have a home at Green Gables as long as Matthew and I are here, but nobody knows what is going to happen in this uncertain world, and itâ\\x80\\x99s just as well to be prepared.

There is no hurry. You wonâ\\x80\\x99t be ready to try the Entrance for a year and a half yet. But itâ\\x80\\x99s well to begin in time and be thoroughly grounded, Miss Stacy says.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Diana Barry did not, as her parents did not intend to send her to Queenâ\\x80\\x99s. This seemed nothing short of a calamity to Anne. Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the croup, had she and Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when the Queenâ\\x80\\x99s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and Anne saw Diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through the Birch Path and Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep her seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. A lump came into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her uplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. Not for worlds would Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those tears.',\n",

But we canâ\\x80\\x99t have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs. Lynde says. Mrs. Lynde isnâ\\x80\\x99t exactly a comforting person sometimes, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the Queenâ\\x80\\x99s class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby are just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their ambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets through, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband wonâ\\x80\\x99t pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she is just going to college for educationâ\\x80\\x99s sake, because she wonâ\\x80\\x99t have to earn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who are living on charity--_they_ have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to be a minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be anything else with a name like that to live up to. I hope it isnâ\\x80\\x99t wicked of me, Marilla, but really the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh. Heâ\\x80\\x99s such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little blue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will be more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says heâ\\x80\\x99s going to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde says heâ\\x80\\x99ll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest people, and itâ\\x80\\x99s only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

He talked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with them, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the other of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club. But Anne Shirley he simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be ignored. It was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head that she did not care. Deep down in her wayward, feminine little heart she knew that she did care, and that if she had that chance of the Lake of Shining Waters again she would answer very differently. All at once, as it seemed, and to her secret dismay, she found that the old resentment she had cherished against him was gone--gone just when she most needed its sustaining power. It was in vain that she recalled every incident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel the old satisfying anger. That day by the pond had witnessed its last spasmodic flicker. Anne realized that she had forgiven and forgotten without knowing it. But it was too late.',\n",

There was no ciphering her out by the rules that worked with other children. Itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing short of wonderful how sheâ\\x80\\x99s improved these three years, but especially in looks. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a real pretty girl got to be, though I canâ\\x80\\x99t say Iâ\\x80\\x99m overly partial to that pale, big-eyed style myself.

Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now Iâ\\x80\\x99m rejoicing as a strong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday. Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t Mr. Allan preach magnificent sermons?

If I were a man I think Iâ\\x80\\x99d be a minister. They can have such an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearersâ\\x80\\x99 hearts. Why canâ\\x80\\x99t women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was shocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might be female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank goodness we hadnâ\\x80\\x99t got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we never would. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t see why. I think women would make splendid ministers. When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or anything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no doubt she could preach too with a little practice.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Then a man came in and began distributing the English examination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as I picked it up. Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly as I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green Gables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I knew I could do something with _that_ paper anyhow.',\n",

She knew that all Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she even knew that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the question and that Josie Pye had said there was no doubt in the world that Gilbert would be first; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if she failed.',\n",

But she did hope fervently that she would be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthewâ\\x80\\x99s kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement.

              "  'Diana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically, and finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied around Anneâ\\x80\\x99s slim milk-white throat.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s something so stylish about you, Anne,â\\x80\\x9d said Diana, with unenvious admiration. â\\x80\\x9cYou hold your head with such an air. I suppose itâ\\x80\\x99s your figure. I am just a dumpling. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always been afraid of it, and now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign myself to it.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cBut you have such dimples,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne, smiling affectionately into the pretty, vivacious face so near her own. â\\x80\\x9cLovely dimples, like little dents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream will never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustnâ\\x80\\x99t complain. Am I all ready now?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cAll ready,â\\x80\\x9d assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a much softer face. â\\x80\\x9cCome right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla. Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t she look lovely?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Marilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cShe looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I expect sheâ\\x80\\x99ll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdyâ\\x80\\x99s the most unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when he got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays. Time was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for Anne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything off on him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable, and Matthew plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

              "  'â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m so glad my window looks east into the sun rising,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne, going over to Diana. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s so splendid to see the morning coming up over those long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops. Itâ\\x80\\x99s new every morning, and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest sunshine. Oh, Diana, I love this little room so dearly. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get along without it when I go to town next month.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t speak of your going away tonight,â\\x80\\x9d begged Diana. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want to think of it, it makes me so miserable, and I do want to have a good time this evening. What are you going to recite, Anne? And are you nervous?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cNot a bit. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve recited so often in public I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind at all now. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve decided to give â\\x80\\x98The Maidenâ\\x80\\x99s Vow.â\\x80\\x99 Itâ\\x80\\x99s so pathetic.

Come on.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

She would have much preferred to sit back with the girls, where she could have laughed and chattered to her heartâ\\x80\\x99s content. There was not much of either laughter or chatter in Billy. He was a big, fat, stolid youth of twenty, with a round, expressionless face, and a painful lack of conversational gifts. But he admired Anne immensely, and was puffed up with pride over the prospect of driving to White Sands with that slim, upright figure beside him.',\n",
              "  'Anne, by dint of talking over her shoulder to the girls and occasionally passing a sop of civility to Billy--who grinned and chuckled and never could think of any reply until it was too late--contrived to enjoy the drive in spite of all. It was a night for enjoyment. The road was full of buggies, all bound for the hotel, and laughter, silver clear, echoed and reechoed along it. When they reached the hotel it was a blaze of light from top to bottom. They were met by the ladies of the concert committee, one of whom took Anne off to the performersâ\\x80\\x99 dressing room which was filled with the members of a Charlottetown Symphony Club, among whom Anne felt suddenly shy and frightened and countrified. Her dress, which, in the east gable, had seemed so dainty and pretty, now seemed simple and plain--too simple and plain, she thought, among all the silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her. What were her pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady near her? And how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse flowers the others wore! Anne laid her hat and jacket away, and shrank miserably into a corner. She wished herself back in the white room at Green Gables.',\n",
              "  'It was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel, where she presently found herself. The electric lights dazzled her eyes, the perfume and hum bewildered her. She wished she were sitting down in the audience with Diana and Jane, who seemed to be having a splendid time away at the back. She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress. The stout lady occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed Anne through her eyeglasses until Anne, acutely sensitive of being so scrutinized, felt that she must scream aloud; and the white-lace girl kept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the â\\x80\\x9ccountry bumpkinsâ\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'and â\\x80\\x9crustic bellesâ\\x80\\x9d in the audience, languidly anticipating â\\x80\\x9csuch funâ\\x80\\x9d',\n",

              "  'Unfortunately for Anne, a professional elocutionist was staying at the hotel and had consented to recite. She was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a wonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems on her neck and in her dark hair. She had a marvelously flexible voice and wonderful power of expression; the audience went wild over her selection. Anne, forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the time, listened with rapt and shining eyes; but when the recitation ended she suddenly put her hands over her face. She could never get up and recite after that--never. Had she ever thought she could recite? Oh, if she were only back at Green Gables!',\n",
              "  'At this unpropitious moment her name was called. Somehow Anne--who did not notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace girl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied therein if she had--got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front. She was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each otherâ\\x80\\x99s hands in nervous sympathy.',\n",
              "  'Anne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as she had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience as this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely. Everything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering--the rows of ladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of wealth and culture about her. Very different this from the plain benches at the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of friends and neighbors. These people, she thought, would be merciless critics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement from her â\\x80\\x9crusticâ\\x80\\x9d efforts. She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and miserable. Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness came over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt, must ever after be her portion if she did so.',\n",
              "  'But suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the audience, she saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending forward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to Anne at once triumphant and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and of the effect produced by Anneâ\\x80\\x99s slender white form and spiritual face against a background of palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he had driven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant and taunting. But Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if she had. She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage and determination tingling over her like an electric shock. She _would not_ fail before Gilbert Blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her, never, never! Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her recitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of the room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored to her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness she recited as she had never done before. When she finished there were bursts of honest applause. Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing with shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout lady in pink silk.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cMy dear, you did splendidly,â\\x80\\x9d she puffed. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been crying like a baby, actually I have. There, theyâ\\x80\\x99re encoring you--theyâ\\x80\\x99re bound to have you back!â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, I canâ\\x80\\x99t go,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne confusedly. â\\x80\\x9cBut yet--I must, or Matthew will be disappointed. He said they would encore me.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cThen donâ\\x80\\x99t disappoint Matthew,â\\x80\\x9d said the pink lady, laughing.',\n",
              "  'Smiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint, funny little selection that captivated her audience still further. The rest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her.',\n",
              "  'When the concert was over, the stout, pink lady--who was the wife of an American millionaire--took her under her wing, and introduced her to everybody; and everybody was very nice to her. The professional elocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that she had a charming voice and â\\x80\\x9cinterpretedâ\\x80\\x9d her selections beautifully. Even the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had supper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane were invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne, but Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear of some such invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team, however, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into the calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne breathed deeply, and looked into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.',\n",
              "  'Oh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night! How great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants guarding enchanted coasts.',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cHasnâ\\x80\\x99t it been a perfectly splendid time?â\\x80\\x9d sighed Jane, as they drove away. â\\x80\\x9cI just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and chicken salad every blessed day. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure it would be ever so much more fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great, although I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it was better than Mrs. Evansâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cOh, no, donâ\\x80\\x99t say things like that, Jane,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne quickly, â\\x80\\x9cbecause it sounds silly. It couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be better than Mrs. Evansâ\\x80\\x99s, you know, for she is a professional, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m only a schoolgirl, with a little knack of reciting. Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty well.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve a compliment for you, Anne,â\\x80\\x9d said Diana. â\\x80\\x9cAt least I think it must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it was anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Jane and me--such a romantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he is a distinguished artist, and that her motherâ\\x80\\x99s cousin in Boston is married to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard him say--didnâ\\x80\\x99t we, Jane?--â\\x80\\x98Who is that girl on the platform with the splendid Titian hair? She has a face I should like to paint.â\\x80\\x99 There now, Anne. But what does Titian hair mean?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cBeing interpreted it means plain red, I guess,â\\x80\\x9d laughed Anne. â\\x80\\x9cTitian was a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9c_Did_ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?â\\x80\\x9d sighed Jane. â\\x80\\x9cThey were simply dazzling. Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you just love to be rich, girls?â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWe _are_ rich,â\\x80\\x9d said Anne staunchly. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, we have sixteen years to our credit, and weâ\\x80\\x99re happy as queens, and weâ\\x80\\x99ve all got imaginations, more or less. Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of things not seen. We couldnâ\\x80\\x99t enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t change into any of those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl and wear a sour look all your life, as if youâ\\x80\\x99d been born turning up your nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so stout and short that youâ\\x80\\x99d really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans, with that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully unhappy sometime to have such a look. You _know_ you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, Jane Andrews!â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cI _donâ\\x80\\x99t_ know--exactly,â\\x80\\x9d said Jane unconvinced. â\\x80\\x9cI think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
              "  'â\\x80\\x9cWell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by diamonds all my life,â\\x80\\x9d declared Anne. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m quite content to be Anne of Green Gables, with my string of pearl beads.

Anneâ\\x80\\x99s outfit was ample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made no objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested.

I hear that Jane and Ruby and Josie have got â\\x80\\x98evening dresses,â\\x80\\x99 as they call them, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean you shall be behind them.

As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful motions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green Gables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child in her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking out of her tearful eyes.

But when Anne had gone Diana dried her tears and went to a beach picnic at White Sands with some of her Carmody cousins, where she contrived to enjoy herself tolerably well; while Marilla plunged fiercely into unnecessary work and kept at it all day long with the bitterest kind of heartache--the ache that burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself away in ready tears. But that night, when Marilla went to bed, acutely and miserably conscious that the little gable room at the end of the hall was untenanted by any vivid young life and unstirred by any soft breathing, she buried her face in her pillow, and wept for her girl in a passion of sobs that appalled her when she grew calm enough to reflect how very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature.',\n",

That first day passed pleasantly enough in a whirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne intended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss Stacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same. This meant getting a First Class teacherâ\\x80\\x99s license in one year instead of two, if they were successful; but it also meant much more and harder work. Jane, Ruby, Josie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the stirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work. Anne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in a room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the tall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion she did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically. Yet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old rivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what to do if it had been lacking.',\n",

I suppose heâ\\x80\\x99s making up his mind, here and now, to win the medal. What a splendid chin he has! I never noticed it before. I do wish Jane and Ruby had gone in for First Class, too. I suppose I wonâ\\x80\\x99t feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get acquainted, though. I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends. Itâ\\x80\\x99s really an interesting speculation. Of course I promised Diana that no Queenâ\\x80\\x99s girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever be as dear to me as she is; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lots of second-best affections to bestow. I like the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist. She looks vivid and red-rosy; thereâ\\x80\\x99s that pale, fair one gazing out of the window.

She had a genius for friendship; girl friends she had in plenty; but she had a vague consciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing to round out oneâ\\x80\\x99s conceptions of companionship and furnish broader standpoints of judgment and comparison. Not that Anne could have put her feelings on the matter into just such clear definition. But she thought that if Gilbert had ever walked home with her from the train, over the crisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening around them and their hopes and ambitions therein. Gilbert was a clever young fellow, with his own thoughts about things and a determination to get the best out of life and put the best into it.

Certain facts had become generally accepted. It was admitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down to three--Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, and Lewis Wilson; the Avery scholarship was more doubtful, any one of a certain six being a possible winner.
