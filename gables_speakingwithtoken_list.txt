Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful , and wore white satin and diamonds . But when she began to sing I never thought about anything else . Oh , I ca n't tell you how I felt . But it seemed to me that it could never be hard to be good any more . I felt like I do when I look up to the stars . Tears came into my eyes , but , oh , they were such happy tears . I was so sorry when it was all over , and I told Miss Barry I did n't see how I was ever to return to common life again . She said she thought if we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me . That sounded so prosaic ; but to my surprise I found it true . The ice cream was delicious , Marilla , and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o'clock at night . Diana said she believed she was born for city life . Miss Barry asked me what my opinion was , but I said I would have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her what I really thought . So I thought it over after I went to bed . That is the best time to think things out . And I came to the conclusion , Marilla , that I was n't born for city life and that I was glad of it . It 's nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven o'clock at night once in a while ; but as a regular thing I 'd rather be in the east gable at eleven , sound asleep , but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook . I told Miss Barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed . Miss Barry generally laughed at anything I said , even when I said the most solemn things .

There 'll be a risk , no matter who we get . But I 'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian .

We heard last week she was going , so we sent her word by Richard Spencer 's folks at Carmody to bring us a smart , likely boy of about ten or eleven . We decided that would be the best age -- old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper . We mean to give him a good home and schooling . We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today -- the mail-man brought it from the station -- saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight .

I 've held my tongue though , for I can see Marilla does n't want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all she 's an old maid . But that 's always the way . Folks that has brought up children know that there 's no hard and fast method in the world that 'll suit every child . But them as never have think it 's all as plain and easy as Rule of Three -- just set your three terms down so fashion , and the sum ` ll work out correct . But flesh and blood do n't come under the head of arithmetic and that 's where Marilla Cuthbert makes her mistake . I suppose she 's trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in Anne by dressing her as she does ; but it 's more likely to cultivate envy and discontent . I 'm sure the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other girls ' . But to think of Matthew taking notice of it ! That man is waking up after being asleep for over sixty years .

("`` Marilla is a famous cook . She is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you , Diana , it is uphill work . There 's so little scope for imagination in cookery . You just have to go by rules . The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in . I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me , Diana . I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you , but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life ; and then I took the smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears ; and you never , never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you . Oh , it was such a pathetic tale , Diana . The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake . But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure . Flour is so essential to cakes , you know . Marilla was very cross and I do n't wonder . I 'm a great trial to her . She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week . We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over . Marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it . I meant to cover it just as much as could be , Diana , but when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun -- of course I 'm a Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic -- taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion ; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce . I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry . Diana , fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce ! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters . Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I 'd give the sauce to the pigs ; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow , whichever they wanted to be , so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples . Well , Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning . You know they are very stylish people , especially Mrs. Chester Ross . When Marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table . I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be , for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I was n't pretty . Everything went right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce _ warmed up _ , in the other . Diana , that was a terrible moment . I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out ` Marilla , you must n't use that pudding sauce . There was a mouse drowned in it . I forgot to tell you before . ' Oh , Diana , I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred . Mrs. Chester Ross just _ looked _ at me and I thought I would sink through the floor with mortification . She is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us . Marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word -- then . She just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves . She even offered me some , but I could n't swallow a mouthful . It was like heaping coals of fire on my head . After Mrs. Chester Ross went away , Marilla gave me a dreadful scolding . Why , Diana , what is the matter ? '' ", 50175)

Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how glad she 'd be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she 'd never shed a tear .

I can tell you I wished I 'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews . She had n't anything on her conscience . The girls cried all the way home from school .
