I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you , but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life ; and then I took the smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears ; and you never , never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you . Oh , it was such a pathetic tale , Diana . The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake . But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure . Flour is so essential to cakes , you know . Marilla was very cross and I do n't wonder . I 'm a great trial to her . She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week . We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over . Marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it . I meant to cover it just as much as could be , Diana , but when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun -- of course I 'm a Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic -- taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion ; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce . I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry . Diana , fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce ! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters . Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I 'd give the sauce to the pigs ; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow , whichever they wanted to be , so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples . Well , Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning . You know they are very stylish people , especially Mrs. Chester Ross . When Marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table . I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be , for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I was n't pretty . Everything went right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce _ warmed up _ , in the other . Diana , that was a terrible moment . I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out ` Marilla , you must n't use that pudding sauce . There was a mouse drowned in it . I forgot to tell you before . ' Oh , Diana , I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred . Mrs. Chester Ross just _ looked _ at me and I thought I would sink through the floor with mortification . She is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us . Marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word -- then . She just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves . She even offered me some , but I could n't swallow a mouthful . It was like heaping coals of fire on my head . After Mrs. Chester Ross went away , Marilla gave me a dreadful scolding . Why , Diana , what is the matter ? '' "", ","403,Diana,11,Diana Barry,10,Barry,
